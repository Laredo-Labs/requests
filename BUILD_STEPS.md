# Step-by-Step: Creating Your App Installer

## 🎯 Step 1: Opening Terminal
1. Click the magnifying glass (🔍) in top-right corner of your screen
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Click the Terminal app icon

## 🚀 Step 2: Going to Your Project
1. In Terminal, type:
```bash
cd Downloads            # if your files are in Downloads
cd chatgpt-mac-app     # or whatever your folder is called
```

## ⚙️ Step 3: Making Files Ready
Copy and paste these commands one by one:
```bash
chmod +x build_app.command
chmod +x setup.sh
chmod +x run_app.sh
chmod +x package_mac_app.sh
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Step 4: Running the Build
1. Double-click `build_app.command` in Finder
   - If you see "cannot be opened":
     - Right-click it
     - Choose "Open"
     - Click "Open" again
2. Wait for it to finish
   - You'll see text scrolling
   - Wait for "Build complete!"

## 📦 Step 5: Finding Your Files
1. Look for new `dist` folder
2. Inside you'll find:
   - `ChatGPT Assistant.app`
   - `ChatGPT Assistant.dmg`

## ✅ Step 6: Testing Your App
1. Double-click `ChatGPT Assistant.dmg`
2. Drag the app to Applications
3. Try running it from Applications
4. Make sure it works with your API key

## 🔄 If Something Goes Wrong
If you get errors:
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Check your internet connection
3. Try the commands again
4. If still stuck, start fresh:
   ```bash
   rm -rf dist build
   ```
   Then start from Step 3
